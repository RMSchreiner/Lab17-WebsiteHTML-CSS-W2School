<h2>Thanks for stopping by.</h2>



			<p>A little bit about me. Sometimes I wish I was normal like most people. Something inside of me has always pursued the next challenge,
			the next peak. In 2003 I attended Prescott College in Prescott, AZ. There I studied Wetland Ecology and Expeditionary Travel.
			After college I transitioned to working full time at an outdoor education center in New Hampshire doing maintenance and repair. 
			Soon I was called in new directions and I went to a CDL truck driving school. 
			As a truck driver I have driven to all 48 continental states including Ontario and British Columbia. Driving a truck gave me
			the opportunity to work in North Dakota oil fields in 2015. 
			After coming back from the oil fields to Michigan I applied to Quicken Loans in Detroit and worked as a mortgage banker for 1 year. 
			That position was fun and I grew alot, but did not suit my introversion. 
			I went back to driving a truck and prepared for my next ambition.<br/>
			
		    I've seen a lot of the world and am always excited to learn more. I've had a love for tech since I was young and continue to 
			read about the many ways that technology keeps us as society growing. Im a gifted artist and am working to be a talented software developer. Some of my technical ambitions are 
			to create financial planning tools to help regular people better manage their financial risk. To develop deep diving autonomous robots to explore the ocean depths for extended periods of time. 
			To work on integrating these research vessels with blockchain technology and long term  un-tamperable data storage.
			Also an interest in technologies that empower personal privacy by returning the value of personal data to its rightful owner.   </p>
